Prepare an OU, user & workstation
Before we get into configuring a Group Policy Object (GPO) within Active Directory (AD), let’s set the AD stage to deploy a software package. Via AD Users & Computers, create a Test OU.
Open MGMT01
Make sure FW01 and AD01 is turned on
On MGMT01, click tools and select Active Directory Users and Computers
  Right click on sarah.local
  Select New
  Select Organizational Unit, name it Test OU
  Right click on Test OU
  Select new
  Select User, name it sarah
  Click on Computers
  Right click on WKS01-SARAH
  Select move, move to Test OU folder
For some fun … use Powershell on AD01 via MGMT01 to figure out how to create another OU called “Software Deploy”, move WKS01 and your regular named account into it, and then delete the Test OU.
Open AD01
$powershell (opens powershell)
$New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "Software Deploy"
$Move-ADObject -Identity "OU=Test OU,CN=WKS01-SARAH" -TargetPath "OU=Software Deploy"
