Prepare an OU, user & workstation
Before we get into configuring a Group Policy Object (GPO) within Active Directory (AD), let’s set the AD stage to deploy a software package. Via AD Users & Computers, create a Test OU.
Open MGMT01
Make sure FW01, AD01, WKS01 is turned on
On MGMT01, click tools and select Active Directory Users and Computers
  Right click on sarah.local
  Select New
  Select Organizational Unit, name it Test OU
  Right click on Test OU
  Select new
  Select User, name it sarah
  Click on Computers
  Right click on WKS01-SARAH
  Select move, move to Test OU folder
For some fun … use Powershell on AD01 via MGMT01 to figure out how to create another OU called “Software Deploy”, move WKS01 and your regular named account into it, and then delete the Test OU.
Open AD01
$powershell (opens powershell)
$New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "Software Deploy"
$Move-ADObject -Identity "CN=WKS01-SARAH,OU=Test OU,DC=sarah,DC=local" --TargetPath "OU=Software Deploy,DC=sarah,DC=local"
$Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Identity "OU=Test OU,DC=sarah,DC=local" | Set-ADObject -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion:$false -PassThru | Remove-ADOrganizationalUnit -Confirm:$false

Deploying Software via GPO
One popular GPO feature is deploying software across an AD domain.
On MGMT01, download Putty’s x64-bit Windows Installer Package (uses the .msi file extension). 
Next, create a Share on MGMT01 named ‘Software’ and place Putty’s .msi in it, so users and computers (via GPO) can access & install it.
Go to MGMT01,
Click Files and Storage Services
  Select Shares
  Right click on mgmt01 and select New Share
   New Share Wizard
    Select Profile: SMB Share - Quick, next
    Share Locations: mgmt01, next
    Share Name: Software, next
    Authentification: next
    Share Permissions: next
    Permissions: next
  Right click on the Software share under MGMT01
  Select Open Shares
    Right click address bar and select copy address  
Openweb browser, Type putty chiark in search bar, open first link
Download Putty’s x64-bit Windows Installer Package (uses the .msi file extension).
Click save as and paste addrress in search bar (or type \\mgmt01-sarah.sarah.local\Software) and press enter
Reopen share to make sure its there 

Deliverable 2.  Screenshot showing WKS01 under regular named account, do a quick test of the new Share on MGMT under your regular named account on WKS01 displaying regular account, hostname & share with Putty’s .msi in it, as below:
Log on to WKS01 as sarah (the user made in deliverable 1)
open command prompt
$whoami
$hostname
On WKS01, open File Explorer and type the following addrress in search bar (\\mgmt01-sarah.sarah.local\Software)

Via Group Policy Management feature on MGMT (You may need to install this), create a new GPO named ‘Deploy SW’ within the Software Deploy OU.
  Go back to MGMT01
  Click Tools
    Select Group Policy Management
    Right click on Software Deploy 
    Select Create New GPO, name it Deploy SW
Edit the new GPO by creating a new Software installation, and assign Putty’s .msi package to deploy.
  Right click on Delploy SW
  Select Edit
  Click Policies and Software setting carrots
  Right Click on Software Installation and click new, click package
  Type the following addrress in search bar (\\mgmt01-sarah.sarah.local\Software) and click enter
  Select the putty installer and click open
  Click assigned and click ok
With the new GPO setting, run “gpupdate /force” on WKS01, and then allow the restart when prompted. As always, read the message MS provides to understand why.
Go to WKS01, and open command prompt
$gpupdate /force
  gpudate didn't work, problem with syncronized clocks: use the following command to fix
  go to AD01, type sconfig, changed/synchronized clocks
  
Log on WKS01 under your regular named account (sarah account), and voila ... your new GPO installed Putty.
just type putty in search bar to see if it is installed

Deliverable 3:

  Type Event Viewer in search bar and open
  Click the carrot on Windows Logs
  Select system

  On WKS01
  Open powershell
  $Get-EventLog -LogName System | Where-Object {$_.EventID -eq 302}
